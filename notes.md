# Requirements

A client has hired you to track zoo animals.
For each animal, you must track that their name, species, and all zoos in which they have resided (including zoo name and address).

Determine the database tables necessary to track this information.

Label any relationships between table.

//create two tables
//Note that the foreign key can only be created after the reference table.
exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {
  return knex.schema
    .createTable('farms', tbl => {
      tbl.increments();
      tbl.string('farm_name', 128)
        .notNullable();
    })
    // we can chain together createTable
    .createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
      tbl.increments();
      tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
      tbl.integer('farm_id')
        // forces integer to be positive
        .unsigned()
        .notNullable()
        .references('id')
        // this table must exist already
        .inTable('farms')
    })
};
<!-- Note that the foreign key can only be created after the reference table.

In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key before dropping the table it references. -->


exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {
  // drop in the opposite order
  return knex.schema
    .dropTableIfExists('ranchers')
    .dropTableIfExists('farms')
};


<!-- In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating a intermediary table is identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of foreign keys in unique. -->

.createTable('farm_animals', tbl => {
  tbl.integer('farm_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    // this table must exist already
    .inTable('farms')
  tbl.integer('animal_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    // this table must exist already
    .inTable('animals')

  // the combination of the two keys becomes our primary key
  // will enforce unique combinations of ids
  tbl.primary(['farm_id', 'animal_id']);
});

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seeds
Order is also a concern when seeding.
 We want to create seeds in the same order we created our tables.
  In other words, donâ€™t create a seed with a foreign key, until that reference record exists.

In our example, make sure to write the 01-farms seed file and then the 02-ranchers seed file.

However, we will run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate 02-ranchers before 01-farms. A library called:
 knex-cleaner that provides as easy solution.

Run knex seed:make 00-cleanup 
and npm install knex-cleaner. 

Inside the cleanup seed use the following code.
---------
const cleaner = require('knex-cleaner');

exports.seed = function(knex) {
  return cleaner.clean(knex, {
    mode: 'truncate', // resets ids
    ignoreTables: ['knex_migrations', 'knex_migrations_lock'], // don't empty migration tables
  });
};

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cascading
If a user attempt to delete a record that is references by another record (such as attempting to delete Morton Ranch when entries in our ranchers table references that record), by default the database will prevent it from being deleted. The same thing can happen when updating a record when a foreign key reference.

If we want that delete or update to cascade, in other words deleting a record also deletes all referencing records, we can set that up in our schema.

.createTable('ranchers', tbl => {
    tbl.increments();
    tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);
    tbl.integer('farm_id')
    .unsigned()
    .notNullable()
    .references('id')
    .inTable('farms')
    .onUpdate('CASCADE');
    .onDelete('CASCADE')
})
